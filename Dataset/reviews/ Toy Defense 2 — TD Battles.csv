The first 20-25 levels are rather easy, but after that things get really tough. I think the game has been designed in such a way that will make us spend money in order to proceed from level to level. Perhaps I am wrong, but I doubt it is possible to accomplish any of the higher levels without buying a lot of extra stars."

I like to play strategically ( long term goals) rather than just dealing heavy damage, because of this I usually have a very balanced army compared to the current mission I'm on. I've noticed that sometimes your troops will ignore the passed troop ( closest to your base) rather than try to destroy it. Another bug I've noticed is sometimes ( currently the interceptor) doesn't lvl up when it should be. Plz fix."
